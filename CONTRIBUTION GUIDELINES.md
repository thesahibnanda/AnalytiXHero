# **Contribution Guidelines**

1. **Follow `PEP 8` Style Guide**: Ensure that all code contributions adhere to the PEP 8 style guide for Python. This helps maintain consistency throughout the codebase.

2. **Use Descriptive Commit Messages**: Ask contributors to provide clear and concise commit messages that explain the purpose and scope of their changes.

3. **Clear and Comprehensive Comments**: Ensure that all recent feature changes are thoroughly explained in comments within the relevant script. This helps developers understand the purpose and implementation of the new features.

4. **Update Comments in `setup.py`**: If any modifications are made to the `setup.py` file, contributors should provide comments explaining the changes. This helps maintain transparency and assists other developers in understanding the purpose of the modifications.

5. **Raise an Issue for New Features**: Prioritize the process of raising an issue to propose and discuss new feature requests. This allows for effective collaboration and ensures that the proposed features align with the library's goals and direction.

6. **Update `__all__` Lists**: When adding a new feature, contributors are responsible for updating the `__all__` list within the relevant script (creating one if necessary) and reflecting those changes in the main `__all__` list found in [`__init__.py`](./analytixhero/__init__.py). This ensures that the new feature is properly exposed and accessible to users.

7. **Maintain [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)**: Keep the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) file up to date by documenting all changes, regardless of their type, under the designated <u>'CHANGES'</u> section. This provides a comprehensive overview of the library's evolution and allows users to track modifications easily.

8. **Document New Features**: Request contributors to update the library's documentation to reflect any new features or changes they introduce.

9. **Review Code**: Encourage contributors to review and test their code before submitting a pull request. This helps catch any potential issues early on.

10. **Give Proper Attribution**: Ask contributors to provide proper attribution when utilizing code or resources from other projects or libraries.

11. **Address Issues and Pull Requests Promptly**: As the maintainer, commit to reviewing and responding to issues and pull requests in a timely manner. This helps keep the development process active and encourages community engagement.

12. **Logo and License Changes**: Avoid making any changes to the library's logo or [license terms](./LICENSE) or [contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTION%20GUIDELINES.md) without prior discussion. If such changes are desired, please suggest them by contacting essenbeats@gmail.com.

13. **Add Your Name to [Contributers.md](./CONTRIBUTERS.md)**: Acknowledge contributors by adding their names to the Contributers.md file. This recognizes their valuable contributions and fosters a sense of community involvement.

14. **Be Respectful and Inclusive**: Emphasize the importance of maintaining a respectful and inclusive community. All contributors should adhere to a code of conduct that promotes a positive and welcoming environment.
